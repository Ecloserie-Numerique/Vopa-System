# Find MAC addresses in all files and dont show duplicates and other stuff
grep -hoiIs '[0-9A-F]\{2\}\(:[0-9A-F]\{2\}\)\{5\}' * | sort -u


NGINX logs
# Go to /var/logs/
cd /var/logs/nginx/

# Find all unique IP addresses that connected to the website. This will show 192...
grep -hoiIs -E '([0-9]{1,3}[\.]){3}[0-9]{1,3}' * | sort -u

# Find all unique IP addresses that connected to the website. This will show more details, like what (kind of) device connected.
grep -E '([0-9]{1,3}[\.]){3}[0-9]{1,3}' * | sort -u```
